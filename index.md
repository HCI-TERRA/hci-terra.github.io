The rapid adoption of machine learning (ML) has come with a significant environmental burden due to increased resource usage, yet such material and environmental impacts of AI are no surprise anymore. This workshop is a call for HCI researchers to critically reflect on the energy, water, and other resource overuse of AI systems by not only developing tools but also by supporting researchers, artists, activists and local communities to collect, understand, and equip themselves with knowledge as well as to make their own practices with AI more sustainable. The goal is to lay solid foundations of a community of HCI researchers interested in mitigating the environmental impact of AI and accordingly bring methods from our inherently interdisciplinary domain that go beyond solutionist narratives.
