<!-- # HCI-TERRA: HCI Towards EnviRonmentally Responsible AI -->


## What is this workshop about?

The rapid adoption of AI has come with a significant environmental burden due to increased resource usage, yet such material and environmental impacts of AI are no surprise anymore. Following a successful workshop at FAccT'25, this CHI'26 workshop will consolidate ideas and create a grand challenges and opportunities map of this emerging topic of interest in HCI. 

The goal is to lay solid foundations of building a community of HCI researchers interested in mitigating the environmental impact of AI and accordingly bring methods from our inherently interdisciplinary domain that go beyond solutionist narratives. Topics include but are not limited to how we can support communities impacted by data centers, how we can engage with humor, participatory methods and speculative design futures to build awareness and how to best support the design of eco-feedback tools among others. 

We hope to build a persistent hybrid research area among sustainable HCI and AI. Towards that goal, the planned output of this workshop is a synthesis grand challenges article or manifesto as well a series of follow-up community-building activities such as initiating a mailing-list, reading group and/or Discord channel.

### HCI Challenges and Opportunities to support AI Environmental Sustainability

We have identified five directions of how HCI can support AI environmental sustainability synthesising literature and personal experiences of working in this domain. These are:
- Supporting communities with resistance on the ground
- Participatory approaches for building awareness
- Tools for Eco-feedback
- Understanding and promoting sufficiency
- The impact of HCI research itself

Yet this workshop aims to collectively generate additional opportunities and challenges that go beyond our existing understanding. We will thus ensure that there is space for the participants to shape the workshop discussions and outputs based on their own interests and expertise and encourage participants to send in their perspectives.

## Call for Participation
Participation is open to all seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations of up to 4-pages (less are welcome) in the ACM CHI submission format. References do not count for the total page count. 

Please submit your papers through this form by 10th February (AOE).

The submissions will be reviewed by the workshop organizers and all accepted papers that opt-in will be published through this website and presented at the workshop. Note that according to CHI'26 this needs to be an in-person workshop and at least one author of each accepted submission must attend the workshop.

For any questions please email the lead organiser **georgia.panagiotidou@kcl.ac.uk**.

[Georgia Panagiotidou](https://fourcoffees.github.io/georgiapanagiotidou/){:target="_blank"}, King's College London.
<br>Georgia is an Assistant Professor at King's College London at the department of Informatics. Her work broadly centers around how people engage with environmental data exploring key challenges such as biases, uncertainties, and friction in collective data use. Georgia investigates the environmental impact of AI commencing from the tools and interfaces that developers, end-users and communities experience as probes. Leading this workshop and similar efforts at FAccT, she is building bridges between the domains of HCI, STS and sustainable AI.
