<!-- # HCI-TERRA: HCI Towards EnviRonmentally Responsible AI -->


## What is this workshop about?

The rapid adoption of AI has come with a significant environmental burden due to increased resource usage, yet such material and environmental impacts of AI are no surprise anymore. Following a successful workshop at FAccT'25, this CHI'26 workshop will consolidate ideas and create a grand challenges and opportunities map of this emerging topic of interest in HCI. 

The goal is to lay solid foundations of building a community of HCI researchers interested in mitigating the environmental impact of AI and accordingly bring methods from our inherently interdisciplinary domain that go beyond solutionist narratives. Topics include but are not limited to how we can support communities impacted by data centers, how we can engage with humor, participatory methods and speculative design futures to build awareness and how to best support the design of eco-feedback tools among others. 

We hope to build a persistent hybrid research area among sustainable HCI and AI. Towards that goal, the planned output of this workshop is a synthesis grand challenges article or manifesto as well a series of follow-up community-building activities such as initiating a mailing-list, reading group and/or Discord channel.

### HCI Challenges and Opportunities to support AI Environmental Sustainability

We have identified five directions of how HCI can support AI environmental sustainability synthesising literature and personal experiences of working in this domain. These are:
- Supporting communities with resistance on the ground
- Participatory approaches for building awareness
- Tools for Eco-feedback
- Understanding and promoting sufficiency
- The impact of HCI research itself

Yet this workshop aims to collectively generate additional opportunities and challenges that go beyond our existing understanding. We will thus ensure that there is space for the participants to shape the workshop discussions and outputs based on their own interests and expertise and encourage participants to send in their perspectives.

[**Georgia Panagiotidou**](https://fourcoffees.github.io/georgiapanagiotidou/){:target="_blank"}, King's College London.
<br>Georgia is an Assistant Professor at King's College London at the department of Informatics. Her work broadly centers around how people engage with environmental data exploring key challenges such as biases, uncertainties, and friction in collective data use. Georgia investigates the environmental impact of AI commencing from the tools and interfaces that developers, end-users and communities experience as probes. Leading this workshop and similar efforts at FAccT, she is building bridges between the domains of HCI, STS and sustainable AI.

**Silvia Cazacu**, KU Leuven <br>
Silvia is a PhD student at KU Leuven and a Marie Curie fellow in the Towards Sustainable Open Data Ecosystems project where she focused on the inclusiveness of participatory data practices. Her research applies a feminist lens to critically analyze the power dynamics that emerge between diverse stakeholders who collaborate on infrastructural decisions about data. She combines participatory methods with tangible thinking tools such as data physicalization and serious games to make complex issues visible and negotiable.

**Christina Bremer**, University of Cambridge <br>
Christina is a Research Associate at the University of Cambridge. She is working on the Green Algorithms Initiative, a project that focuses on quantifying and reducing the environmental impacts of computational science. More generally, by applying an HCI lens and combining efficiency with sufficiency principles, her works aims to help limit the environmental impacts of computing technology and use computing to facilitate environmentally sustainable decision-making and behaviors.

**Sinem Görücü**, King's College London <br> 
Sinem is a PhD student at King's College London researching the environmental sustainability of machine learning through a Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) lens. Her work examines how practitioners perceive and engage with sustainability in AI development, and explores participatory and tangible approaches to making environmental costs of computing visible and actionable. Her research spans sustainable HCI, data physicalization, and participatory design.
